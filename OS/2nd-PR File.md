<p>Let us take some real life examples to understand that exactly why there is a need of an Operating System. We all use switch to operate a fan, if switch is not there then will it be possible to start a fan ?<br>
Maybe, it is possible by doing some connections of  wires. But, everybody cannot operate with those wires , right ?<br>
And if we talk about operating a switch, everyone can easily operate it. So here in this case, a switch is acting like an <strong>interface</strong>.</p>
