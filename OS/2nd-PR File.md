<h2 id="what-does-operating-system-do-">What does Operating System Do ?</h2>
<p>You must have heard about Windows , Linux , MAC OS . What are  these ?<br>
All of these are an Operating Systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>An <strong>operating system</strong> is a system software that acts as an interface between a user and the hardware and controls the execution of all kinds of programs.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-an-operating-system-">Why do we need an Operating System ?</h2>
<p>Let us take some real life examples to understand that exactly why there is a need of an Operating System. We all use switch to operate a fan, if switch is not there then will it be possible to start a fan ?<br>
Maybe, it is possible by doing some connections of  wires. But, everybody cannot operate with those wires , right ?<br>
And if we talk about operating a switch, everyone can easily operate it. So here in this case, a switch is acting like an <strong>interface</strong>.<br>
Similarly in a computer , we have a lot of different hardwares ( For example , Memory , processor , Input-Ouput devices etc). So, if we want to interact with each of them then , we need to write programs for each hardware everytime when we want to interact . And writing such programs again and again , is not an effecient way of managing things. Hence, here comes the requirement of an Operating Systems for us.</p>
<p>An <strong>Operating System</strong> makes the interaction of a user and a Hardware very easy and effecient such that even a naive user can access it knowing just the basics.</p>
<p>There are some major goals of an Operating System :</p>
<h2 id="goals-of-operating-system">Goals of Operating System</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Primary Goal - Convenience</strong> : User using the Operating System must find it easy to interact with System. It should make the computer system very convenient to use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secondary Goal - Effecient</strong> : It must give maximum output with minimum input. It should use the resources effeciently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To accomplish these goals , operating system has to play certain functionalities -</p>
<h2 id="functions-of-operating-system">Functions of Operating System</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Process Management</strong> : As user would be working on number of processes  so which process will be executed first and for how much time. , allocating/deallocating various processes to processor and from the processor all of this is done by Operating System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Memory Management</strong> : For a program / process to get executed requires memory. As there can be more than one program present at a time. Hence, it is important  to manage the memory. So, how much memory to allocate/deallocate to a process or to be kept as a free memory is all handled by Operating System.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Input-Output Device Management</strong> : Operating System keeps tracks of all the I/O devices and manages the connections , for how much time a particular process should be given to a device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>File Management</strong> : A file system consists of many files and directories. OS keeps track of every location, information , users , status etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Management</strong> : Operating System manages all the network connections and devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security &amp; Privacy</strong> : It is the task of an Operating System to manage all the users, to authorise user or unauthorise any restricted user to access and keeping track of such activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
